# independent-GUI

For this project you are to create a new GUI program that has the following elements in it at some point:
-Arrays
-New Methods
-Text Fields
-Buttons

This project will serve as a quiz grade and needs to be of the quality as such. If you have questions then you can talk to Mr. James about it. 


***This will be your first assignment on a public repo. This means that you will have the option to collaborate with each other if you choose to. But, you must each turn in an individual assignment.
